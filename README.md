My first repo.  Making sure I know what I'm doing, somewhat
Hello I have been a network engineer for 11 years.  I am currently responsible for the design, implementation and maintanence of a greenfield global datacenter.  I've always been interested in software development.  I like javascript / node.js and python.  My primary focus at this point is python.  I have been doing a lot of network programming.  My goal is to be able to dynamically map our network, understand how it is performing in real-time, how it is performing compared to normal operating modes, forwarding decisions, etc.
I don't typcially use version control which I understand makes my a rookie.  This is first repository.  I'm going through the walkthroughs to understand the ins and outs of github.  More to come...
